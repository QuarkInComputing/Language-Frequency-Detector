# Language-Frequency-Detector

Python script that detects the provided language from a text file by analysing the frequency of letters

# Use

## File Selection

The file to be read should be pasted into ``text/yourfile.txt`` as a *text file*.

Deending on the filename, make sure to adjust the script accordingly,

```py
### Vars that can be adjusted
tolerance = 0.1 
filepath = ".txt" # Insert file name here
###
```

## Tolerance

If the script is not able to detect a language with a sufficent percentage, adjust the tolerance found at the top of the script alongwith the filename variable.

```py
### Vars that can be adjusted
tolerance = 0.1 #Tolerance can be adjusted here
filepath = ".txt"
###
```
